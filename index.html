    <p class="text2">Music History of Shiosan</p>
    <p>I love music. I have listened to really cool music since I was a teenager. 
        <br>Here is my music history. </p>

    <p>I started getting into music when I was 12-13 years old. That's when I listend to Beatles.</p>

   <p>Then I got into Western music, so I made more friends who loved music and started 
    listening to many kinds of Western music. But at that time, there was a little information. 
    I only see MTV or read foreign music magazine which was rare at that time.
    <br>In that situation, we only had two ways to go. we either follow the trend or get wierd.
    At first, I follow the trend too. 
    <br>Bon Jovi, Motley Crue.</p>

   <p>But things have changed since Guns N' Roses came on the scene.</p>

   <p>After they showed up, I started looking at every bit of information they had.
    Then I got to know their roots and the music they grew up listening to.
    <br>Hanoi Rocks, Aerosmith, Kiss, and etc.
    <br>As an aside, I remember Axel Rose said that he was told gospel music as a child.

   <p>In addition, I got to look into the roots of these musicians. In the process, I got into the 70s and 80s.</p>
   <p>Chuck Berry, Rolling Stones, Sex Pistols...</p>

   <p>That's when things started to get crazy. As I followed the roots, and then the roots again. 
    I got hooked on a wide range of music from the 60's to the 90's.
    <br>Johnny Thuders, New York Dolls, Ramones, Janis Joplin, Muddy Waters, Bob Dylan, and etc.

<p>Now that I think about it, I was a mucky high school student, but at the same time, I am proud of it.</p>
